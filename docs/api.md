# API Routes

The VFrame Search application incorporates a RESTful API for running searches
and talking to the database.  APIs either process commandline parameters directly,
or accept POST/PUT input as JSON.  For the most part, APIs return JSON with the
following structure:

```
{ 'status': 'ok', 'res': ... }
{ 'status': 'error', 'error': ... }
```
